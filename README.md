## Overview
This repository describes simple demo ELT pipeline projects. All of them:
  - are orchestrated by Airflow, so the DAG python file is the controlling code.
  - use AWS services (Lambda, S3, and Glue)
  - require AWS keys to operate.
  - those with API calls probably require a current API key.
